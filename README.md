T5 is an encoder-decoder model. It converts all language problems into a text-to-text format.

Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5) is a Transformer-based model built on the encoder-decoder architecture, pretrained on a multi-task mixture of unsupervised and supervised tasks where each task is converted into a text-to-text format. T5 shows impressive results in a variety of sequence-to-sequence (sequence in this notebook refers to text) like summarization, translation, etc.
